title: "Looking Back at SQL Saturday Los Angeles 2022"

This past weekend I was lucky enough to attend [SQL Saturday Los Angeles 2022](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-08-13-sqlsaturday1029/). This was the third SQL Saturday I'd been to in LA, and it was once again at [Loyola Marymount University](https://www.lmu.edu/), which is a just north of the airport on a hill outside Marina Del Ray.

It was a beautiful day in LA, and as I drove up in the morning, I decided to walk around campus a bit. It must be a wonderful place to go to school, and as I came over to the event building from the back, I saw lunch tables set up outside for people.

Since it's LA, quite a bit of the event is outside. Registration was in its own tent, with a sign on top and attendee badges sorted in a stand. This is one thing that I think can help other organizers, as badges in a pile or laying out on tables can be mixed up and moved around.

There was also a printer available if anything needed to be redone, which is always a good idea.

There was evena Social Media tent with a few volunteers taking pictures throughout the day.

The day starts slowly in LA, perhaps because of traffic, but there were only a few people there when [Anna Hoffman](https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna) and I started the opening keynote. I had a few brief remarks on SQL Saturday and then Anna talked a little SQL Server and Azure, which is something she does often for [Azure SQL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNsev6sULZ_Zp06VL7uktuA?view_as=subscriber).

The sessions were in three classrooms on the second floor of the building. Each has a nice tech setup, as this is a college. The rooms are bright and airy, windows open, and school desk setups. Here you see Anna delivering a talk it the first session.

One thing the organizers did was put up session titles outside each room with the times. This is really handy when a crowd of people are in the hallway. Anyone walking by, even behind others, can see this.

The audiences were a mix of professionals from all ages and technologies, but they asked interesting questions and were engaged in talks. [Jeff Iannucci](https://twitter.com/desertdba) had the audience entranced with his talk on Execution Plans.

There were nice breaks between sessions, 30 minutes, which gave people a chance to walk outside, see vendors, and get a snack. You can see vendors set up in a line outside, and a tent with snacks and coffee throughout the day, with lunch placed on the same tables.

Most of the people stayed the entire day. While it was a smaller crowd than years past, it was an engaged one. Quite a few people expressed how nice it was to meet in person and learn something. I am hopeful that 2023 and 2024 will see continued growth in all events.

There were plenty of volunteers, including a few cute fun ones that watched the speaker room and brought water to the rooms to presenters. I got a selfie with a couple of them.

The raffle was entirely an e-raffle, with attendees scanning QR codes at each booth and entering information on their phones. I don't know that I like this, but I helped give out the prizes at the end and it was simple to read off names from a SQL Server database. Order by NEWID(), of course.
