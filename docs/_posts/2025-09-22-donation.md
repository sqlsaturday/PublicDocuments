title: "A Generous Donation from NESQL"
author: Steve Jones

The SQL Saturday Charity received another incredible donation from the New England SQL User Group, which should fund most of our operations for the next year. After another amazing SQL Saturday in Boston, I was presented with a generous check from the organizers.

Huge thanks to sponsors and the New England SQL User Group for their donation.

I try to run SQL Saturday with a minimal budget and a donation of my time to help events run and inspire, teach, and train data professionals.

Please pass the word about events to your friends and colleagues, attend if you can, volunteer when you are able, and help us carry this amazing community forward.


## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
