Welcome to the January 2024 SQL Saturday Update. This month we have a few

- Upcoming Events
- News

Happy New Year! I hope everyone is having a good start to a new calendar year. We're excited for 2024 at SQL Saturday with some growth and new events coming, as well as a number of repeating events. It was a quiet holiday for me, but I did manage to close out our financials for 2023 in the [year-end review](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2023-12-21-yearreview/), and we finished in a good position. We've got plenty of funding, and we are working on securing more global partners in 2024.

I do want to plug [SQL Bits 2024](https://sqlbits.com/). This is a paid conference, but they have a free day of training on Saturday. You can see all the reasons to attend, but this has been my favorite conference over the years. There are some very enjoyable events, but SQL Bits combines world class training with a lot of fun and a family friendly atmosphere.

I won't be there this year with a schedule conflict, but I do recommend this highly if you can get near London in March 2024. The event is in Farnborough, which is about a 40 minute train ride from London, and as you can see from the logo above, the theme is aviation. Get your flying costumes ready for the Friday night party.

I think Grant Fritchey is getting ready. I'm not confident he can fly himself there, but he appears ready to do so.

If you want to register, there is a discount code from Redgate (redgate10) as well as a few others floating around. This is worth your training budget if you can attend.

If you have any comments, questions, or ideas, please feel free to reach out to us at admin@sqlsaturday.com.

Thanks for reading,

Steve Jones
President, SQL Saturday

## SQL Saturday News
There is not a lot is happening with SQL Saturday since the year end review. We have had some offers for funding and discussions on raising money, but since I don't have a good use for more, I'm avoiding doing anything for now. If anything, I'd like to reduce the costs for SQL Saturday.

We would like to add more tooling to help events run smoother. We did see EventBrite is now charging for events. Their [new pricing](https://www.eventbrite.com/organizer/pricing/) is USD $49.99 for unlimited tickets for an event. That might be annoying to some organizers, but this is a very reasonable cost in my mind for the service. We do have a few events looking at [Zeffy](https://www.zeffy.com/) as an alternative services. If anyone uses that, or anything else, please let us know (admin@sqlsaturday.com).

Microsoft continues to sponsor events as a global partner and we are passing through 100% of their sponsorship money to the events. SQL Saturday is not charging any fees for this and we are very grateful for their support.

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.

If you want an event in your area, get involved with your user group, or contact us about running your own event. It's not that hard, and it doesn't have to be a lot of work, but it does take some effort.
