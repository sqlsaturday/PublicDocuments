title: "Changing Our Description"

I made a change today to the website. I changed the description for SQL Saturday to:

"Welcome to SQL Saturday, the free community event franchise for database professionals and those working with data across any platform."

It used to say: 

I've had a few people ask if they could accept non-SQL Server/Azure sessions at events. I've also had them talk about getting vendors from competing technologies. We haven't had any restrictions on this for a long time, and we've had lots of events that cover plenty of non-Microsoft technologies.

I just made it official.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
