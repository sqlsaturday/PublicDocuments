title: "A New Microsoft Contract for FY2026H1"
author: Steve Jones

Working with sponsors is always a little stressful, especially these days with budgets and funding receiving lots of scrutiny. However, I have good news. SQL Saturday completed a contract for FY2026 H1 with Microsoft and AMD to sponsor all (fingers crossed) events from July - Dec 2025.

Microsoft works on a fiscal year that begins in July, and things took longer than expected this year, but we were able to secure a contract that should fund all events for the rest of 2025.

Huge thanks to Microsoft and AMD for supporting SQL Saturday.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
