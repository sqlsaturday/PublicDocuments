title: "A Fun Networking Game at SQL Saturday"

I was lucky to attend SQL Saturday Boston 2023. At the end of the raffle, I helped run the prizes for a networking game, which I really enjoyed. They did this in 2022 as well and I think it's a great way to encourage people to meet someone new, as well as have some fun.

Each person gets a few index cards at the beginning of the day in their registration packet. They are supposed to sign their name on one side and meet someone new who will sign the other side. 

They turn in the signed cards and we draw names out of a box. Each person who signed the card (2 of them) gets a prize. There is a limit of 5 prizes for any one person.

## The Prizes

Here's the fun part. The event gets USD$200 in cash, in $10 bills. That means that we give away $20 for each card drawn. Any one person can win $50, and even if one person has left, we give the other person $10.

This is on the honor system, as you aren't supposed to have friends sign your cards. So far it's worked well and I have to admit that it's a lot of fun handing out cash prizes.
