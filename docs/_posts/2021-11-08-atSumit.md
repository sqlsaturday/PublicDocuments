title: "SQL Saturday at the PASS Data Community Summit"
author: Steve Jones
---

This week is the [PASS Data Community Summit](https://passdatacommunitysummit.com/), and lots of us are attending in the #SQLFamily. I miss attending in person, and hopefully that will change next year.

One of the items I looked forward to was the annual gathering of SQL Saturday event organizers. With SQL Saturday, and related events like Data Saturday, being distributed, we won't have that, but I have arranged for a space.

There is a neat platform running the Community Zone this year. It's [Spatial Chat](https://spatial.chat/) and I've enjoyed using it at my company. There are a number of rooms, and I've arranged for a SQL Saturday room there.

I'll be in and out from Wed-Fri, but there are three specific times I will be there:
- Wed, Nov 10, 2021 - 16:00-17:30 EST
- Thu, Nov 11, 2021 - 12:00-13:30 EST
- Fri, Nov 12, 2021 - 10:00 - 11:13 EST

Drop by and say hi, or bring questions, ideas, and more. Pass the word to others that might be interested.

I am hoping we start to get more events moving in 2022, and I hope some of you will get involved.
