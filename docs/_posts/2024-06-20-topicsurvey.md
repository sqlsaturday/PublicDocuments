Most events pick a schedule from the submissions they receive from speakers. However, that is a limited set of topics, and reflects what speakers are interested in (or they think you are interested in), not necessarily what a group of people are interested in. 

<a href="https://twitter.com/steverezhener">Steve Rezhener</a> from LA had a great idea to run a survey of topics. He built a nice, simple form that covers a lot of the

And pass it along to others.

The results are here: <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/AnalysisPage.aspx?AnalyzerToken=7mbJB42tWkEsCzue5DaCLEvUMJktBGMV&id=gnmDOfwlxUSOk0IzXgzjZxTcgv_7oyhCixJqoQUh4pBUQTRNMkhPUVRFTkhNUDZCM1FCUkRYVEJNRi4u">Survey Results</a>

Pass the links along to others. I've created redirects at SQL Saturday:

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
