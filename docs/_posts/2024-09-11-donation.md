We received another USD$150 donation from Benevity, which is fantastic. While we do not have many expenses at SQL Saturday, we do occassionally loan money to events in anticipation of sponsorship being paid. Timing can sometimes be an issue with vendors paying and organizers spending money to prepare for an event.

I am very thankful for those of you that are helping support SQL Saturday.

## A Regular Reminder

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
