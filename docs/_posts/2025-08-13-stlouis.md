title: "St Louis is Back!"

I was thrilled (and surprised) to see an issue open on the SQL Saturday site for St Louis earlier this year. I have been hoping they would run another event as there has been a strong community there for years.

SQL Saturday St Louis 2025 is coming on Oct 18, and you can still <a href="">submit a session</a> or <a href="">register to attend</a>. No matter what you do, pass the word to others.

I am thrilled to see them continue to progress their event and am looking forward to hearing how this goes. I would love to attend, but I am trying to watch my travel and I have a conflicting trip at that time. Hopefully they will run an event next year and I'll have the opportunity to go.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
