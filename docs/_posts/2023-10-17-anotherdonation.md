title: "A Donation from SQL Saturday Boston"
author: Steve Jones

I was lucky to attend SQL Saturday Boston 2023. At the end of the event, the organizers wrote a donation check to SQL Saturday for USD$100.

This was a very thoughtful and generous gift, and I'm grateful. A few donations have been helpful in covering our annual expenses as well as bank fees for sponsorship transfers. We aim to send 100% of any sponsorship funds to the events and cover transfer fees.

SQL Saturday is a 501.c.3 registered charity in the US, and we want to continue to act as a charitable organization that helps communities around the world train, teach, and inspire data professionals.

We appreciate all the support of SQL Saturday from everyone, in any form.
