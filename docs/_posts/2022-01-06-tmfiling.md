title: "Additional Trademark Filings"

We have additional trademark filings for the SQL Saturday brand. I received the [Australian filing](/assets/pdf/AustraliaFullAssignment_2021.pdf).

This means we have the US, EU, and Australia trademarks.

Unfortunately, because of Brexit and delays, the UK trademark is still in the name of the former PASS organization. We are working to get that registration changed.
