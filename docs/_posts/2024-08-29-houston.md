SQL Saturday Houston is back! 

We are planning [SQL Saturday Houston 2024 (#1098)](https://sqlsaturday.com/houston), with a date of December 7, 2024. We are looking for speakers, sponsors, and volunteers. 

And, of course, attendees. [Register today](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sql-saturday-houston-tickets-974427949227?aff=oddtdtcreator) and come join us on Dec 7.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
