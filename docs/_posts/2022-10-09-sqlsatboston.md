SQL Saturday Boston 2022 took place on October 8, 2022 at the Microsoft office in Burlington, MA. This was a location that has hosted other SQL Saturday events in the Boston area. As near as I can tell, this was the 14th event in Boston.

The team running this event is experienced and motivated. They did a fantastic job prepping things, managing the schedule, and communicating. I received numerous emails as a speaker and attendee that let me know how the event would proceed.

One of the more interesting things I saw was the use of normal A4 (8.5x11) paper to showcase a few different things important to attendees outside of each room. As you can see below, there is this information:

- Room number (which is on the schedule)
- A schedule for this room
- A flyer for the user group
- The Code of Conduct
- A QR code linking to the schedule and venue map

I think this was a great set of things that are easy to produce, don't require special printing, and can easily be posted, or replaced, as needed. 

I've seen people print large schedules, which is a extra expense and effort. I also see the entire schedule printed. which is hard to read. As I get older, I appreciate larger printed fonts.

My only suggestions here would be to print the room schedule larger, and then raise the signs up to about a 6 foot height. That way people can still see the items posted when a crowd is outside the room.

Overall this worked well with a medium crowd, and made it easy to see what was coming in each room.
