title: "Happy New Year with a Donation"
author: Steve Jones

I came back to work today to find an unexpected bonus for SQL Saturday. We recevied another donation from America Online Giving for $425, which I greatly appreciate. We had a few more expenses last year with email services and bank fees. We also covered a missing sponsorship for an event, so this donation will help us cover those costs. I'm grateful for the support and the help in keeping our organization running smoothly.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
