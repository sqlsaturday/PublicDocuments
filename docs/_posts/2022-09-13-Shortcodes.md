title: "Short Codes for Events"
author: Steve Jones

When we formed the SQL Saturday corporation and had the first event in Los Angeles in 2021, the organizers requested a short code for their event. They thought these URLS were a little cumbersome:
- https://sqlsaturday.com/2021-06-12-sqlsaturday1020/
- https://sqlsaturday.com/1020/

They wanted something easier to remember, like this: https://sqlsaturday.com/la

We implemented that with a redirect file in the repo. You can actually see the file [here](https://github.com/sqlsaturday/sqlsatwebsite/blob/main/la.html), and this file has been updated to point from the 2021 event to the 2022 event.

We've continued this trend, and for new events, we've created these URLs:
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/denver](https://sqlsaturday.com/denver)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/orlando](https://sqlsaturday.com/orlando)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/boston](https://sqlsaturday.com/boston)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/memphis](https://sqlsaturday.com/memphis)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/toronto](https://sqlsaturday.com/toronto)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/richmond/](https://sqlsaturday.com/richmond/)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/saopaulo/](https://sqlsaturday.com/saopaulo/)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/nepal/](https://sqlsaturday.com/nepal/)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/oregon](https://sqlsaturday.com/oregon)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/bangladesh](https://sqlsaturday.com/bangladesh)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/mn](https://sqlsaturday.com/mn)
- [https://sqlsaturday.com/lima](https://sqlsaturday.com/lima)

You can use these short code, like /denver, as a quick way to get to the current event.

I've also started to add the shortcodes for some previous events. 
For example, [https://sqlsaturday.com/kc/](https://sqlsaturday.com/kc/) goes to their last event, which was #901 in 2019. I'm slowly adding these to other past events.

I am often choosing the city, but I am happy to use other codes if organizers want them. These are in a common namespace, so each needs to be unique among all events.
