title: "VMWare Sponsoring SQL Saturday"
author: Steve Jones
---
I am pleased to announce the VMWare/Broadcom has agreed to sponsor a number of SQL Saturdays in 2024. They have allocated funds from their marketing budget and are working with many of the currently scheduled events to provide support. 

VMWare was a strong sponsor of our events prior to the pandemic, and we are thrilled they have made the decision to return to the community. We are grateful for their support and look forward to working with them to help make our events successful.

Please thank them if you see them at an event, or reach out to them on social media. 

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
