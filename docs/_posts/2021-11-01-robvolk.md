I got back from the first 2021 in-person SQL Saturday in Orlando yesterday. It was a great event, and I'll have some notes and thoughts coming, but I wanted to congratulate Rob Volk ( [@sql_r](https://twitter.com/sql_r)) for speaking at over 100 events. I think Orlando 2021 was actually his 101st event.

## Congratulations, Rob

This is quite an achievement. Only a few people have spoken at over 100 events. I haven't gotten to 100 myself, though I hope to get there one day. This is quite an investment of time, effort, and money to get there, and we should all thank Rob for his efforts.
