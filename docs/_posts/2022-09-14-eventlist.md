One of the things that any organizers and events are proud of is their history. We've had a number of commemorative events that hit their 10th event. This past year, [Jacksonville 2022](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-05-14-sqlsaturday1022/) was recognized as the 14th event in that city.

As I've [added tags] to events, we get an autogenerated list of previous events with those tags. Since I add tags based on the location, we can find all the events (or all tagged events) for a particular city. For example, [Orlando](https://sqlsaturday.com/tags/#Orlando) has had 13 events tagged.

I decided to add this to the event pages, putting a list of event accessible from the current event. This takes advantage of how Jekyll produces the tags to auto generate the URL. You can see this on the current [Orlando page](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-10-08-sqlsaturday1030/). There is a section for [previous events](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-10-08-sqlsaturday1030/#previous) that links to the tags.

As more tags are added, this will slowly form a complete history of SQL Server for all events.

Now to update the primary tag for current and recent events.
