In 2023, we've had quite a bit of growth in South and Central America for SQL Saturday. This has been an area where a number of communities have been running events post-pandemic, and I'm delighted that they continue to thrive.

This past weekend for [SQL Saturday Vitória 2023](https://sqlsaturday.com/2023-10-28-sqlsaturday1065/), a place I'd never heard of before the organizers registered the event. I was thrilled to hear the event was a success with 468 people attending. You can see some of them in the image below from the organizers.

There were over 1000 registered, which is a great crowd for any event, but it's amazing for a post-pandemic free event.

In 2023, we've had a few events in Peru and Brazil and another in Costa Rica. We still have a few more scheduled in December and I'm hoping to see more in 2024.

I'm also hoping to plan a trip to one or more of these events as I've never been to South America.

If you want to see an event in your area, reach out to your local user group or us here at SQL Saturday and we'll see if we can get one organized. However, if you want to attend an event, remember that volunteering helps ensure the event can take place as these events depend on the efforts of people just like you.
