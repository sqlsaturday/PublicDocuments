I love seeing the growth of SQL Saturday in different places. The last few years have seen quite a few events take place in South America, and specifically Peru, where Juan Manuel Rafael Fabian has run events in many locations. 

The latest was Lima a few weeks ago. The event went well, and there are some [great pictures on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.606835561695577&type=3) from the event.

This is one I hope to attend one of these years, and I've already noted on my calendar they've reserved dates for two events in 2025.


## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
