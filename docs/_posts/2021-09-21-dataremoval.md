title: "Data Removal Requests"

I have gotten a couple of data removal requests sent to the SQL Saturday webmaster, and decided to write up how I handle these. This may change in the future, but for now, this is the process.

When someone sends a data removal requests, I act on these promptly. While the GDPR gives me a month to respond, I know if I get one of these, I'd like prompt action. 

The [EU has a template](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-erasure-request-form/), which I like. One person used most of this in their email. I do not go back and forth to verify the person sending this is the asking to be removed. They have an email and a name, which is good enough for me at this time.

## The Removal Process

When I get a request, I check our system. In this case, we only have a mailing list in MailChimp, which only the board of directors can access. I search all contacts for the person's name and email.

If they are found, I delete the contact immediately.

## Communication

Once I have completed my check and action, if any, I email the person back. So far, the requests have come from people that received emails in 2019 or earlier. I don't have this data, so I send this back:

_Thank you for your request._

_We are a different entity than the previous organization that ran SQL Saturdays. We received the trademark and brand as a donation from Redgate Software, who purchased these assets from the PASS organization in 2021. No data or code was a part of this sale, and we have not received any data. Our mailing list was created in 2021 as a signup opt-in process, and I do not see your name in our contact list._

_The previous organization has dissolved, but the assets were managed by Christianson and Company ([https://www.ccevent.com/](https://www.ccevent.com/)). They held all data assets, and they would be the ones to contact to confirm they have in fact deleted all this date._

_If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to ask._

So far, I have not received any followup comments from the requesters.

## Feedback and Comments

If you feel this is insufficient, or if you think this is OK, please feel free to let me or any of the board members know what you think. We are willing to handle these items in accordance with both legal requirements and the wishes of the community.
