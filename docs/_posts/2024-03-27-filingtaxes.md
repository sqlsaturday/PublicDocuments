title: "Filing 2023 Tax Returns"

I filed the SQL Saturday Corporation tax return as a Form 990-N today. This is a short form filing for organizations that have less than USD$50,000 in revenue. That suits SQL Saturday, as we raised only $225 in donations.

We do escrow money from sponsors, but this isn't revenue as it is a pass through for various events.

A necessary step to perform each year, but by keeping our revenue below $50,000, this is really a ten minute procedure.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
