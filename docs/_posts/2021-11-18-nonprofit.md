title: "SQL Saturday is a Registered 501.c.3 Corporation"
author: Steve Jones

I applied for non-profit status for the SQL Saturday corporation over the summer. I submitted an [IRS Form 1023-EZ](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1023ez.pdf) to classify our organization as a 501(c)(3) corporation. This is a non-profit entity that exists to further a charitable cause, which is the goal with this entity.

I checked a few times, but the IRS was backed up and hadn't completed review when I last checked in late August. I got busy, and it wasn't until last week that I was able to spend an hour on the phone waiting for someone to answer. 

I got the news that we are officially granted this status, which means we can take advantage of some of the non-profit offers from Microsoft and others, and also help run events as a non-profit entity if we have the need. I've submitted our information to [TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org/) and will start to acquire services as necessary to support events.

You can see the [letter of determination here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/detailsPage?ein=863831980&name=Sql%20Saturday&city=Dallas&state=TX&countryAbbr=US&dba=&type=CHARITIES,%20DETERMINATIONLETTERS&orgTags=CHARITIES&orgTags=DETERMINATIONLETTERS). Apparently a paper copy was sent, but never made it to my house.

Glad I checked.
