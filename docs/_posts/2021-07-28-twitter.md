The SQL Saturday corporation and franchise is back on Twitter at [@sqlsatofficial](https://twitter.com/sqlsatofficial).

While there are a few other unofficial "SQL Saturday accounts", they are controlled by members of the community. They aren't really used, and I have not been able to get the holders to release those accounts or post anything for us. I'm a bit saddened by this, but we need a way to reach various people on social media, so I've set up this new account. If that changes, we'll look to post announcements and information on all accounts.

For now, please spread the word that this account is available.
