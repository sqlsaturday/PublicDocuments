The SQL Saturday site is based on work that I helped the [DataSaturdays](https://datasaturdays.com/index.html#aboutus) project with when the PASS organization folded. [Rob Sewell](https://blog.robsewell.com/) did a lot of the work, and I helped tweak a few very minor things before forking the idea for [SQL Saturday](https://sqlsaturday.com/).

I've tweaked and adjusted the site a bit, which is using the [Jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme. I've added some tweaks, which work well and we have our own layout for events.

That being said, on [the beta site](beta.sqlsaturday.com) I'm experimenting with a few things, like quickly showing the CFS status. However, I'm struggling a bit with layout,centering, and in general, making things look good.

I'm asking if there are any people out there with web design/layout skills that would like to take on a small side project, submit some PRs and get credit here supporting the community. We run this site and franchise on a volunteer basis, so I don't have many funds to spend, so I'm hoping there is someone that wants to give back to the community and donate here as an Open Source effort.

The [beta Github repo](https://github.com/sqlsaturday/testwebsite) is available for forking, and you can send any questions to admin@sqlsaturday.com.
