title: "An Unexpected Donation"

When I opened the mail a couple weeks ago, there was an envelope addressed to SQL Saturday. It was from an organization called [Benevity](https://benevity.com/), who works with corporations that donate to non profits and charities. 

Inside the envelope was a check for USD$200, that someone had donated. I didn't get information on the source, but we certainly appreciate the donation.
