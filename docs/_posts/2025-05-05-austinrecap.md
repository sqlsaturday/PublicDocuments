SQL Saturday Austin 2025 was held recently and it was a really fun event. Thanks to Procure SQL for organizing and running this event. They had a <a href="https://procuresql.com/blog/2023/03/08/austin-texas-sql-saturday-was-a-success/">recap on their blog</a> and I had one as well. Conor Cunningham gave a keynote and I <a href="https://voiceofthedba.com/2025/05/12/sql-server-engineering-in-austin/">wrote about it</a>. It was fantastic and if you get the chance to see Conor speak, go.

A smaller event, but still great. Lots of good talks, nice conversations, and the chance to connect with others, share some knowledge, and learn new things.

This event reminded me why SQL Saturdays are great events for your career. Go to an event near you and help your local community organize their own event. It's a great investment in your career.

## Reminders

I also want to remind people that [SQL Saturday is an independent US 501.c.3 corporation](https://blog.sqlsaturday.com/2021-11-18-nonprofit/) organized as a public charity. We are not owned by, or managed by Redgate Software. Redgate donated the brand to the corporation and gave us a grant to run events, but there is no oversight of the corporation. Redgate does maintain a permanent seat on the board of directors, currently occupied by Steve Jones, but has no more influence than any of the other members of the board.
