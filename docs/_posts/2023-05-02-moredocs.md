title: "Updating Site Docs"
author: Steve Jones
---
tl;dr - I have added a new menu item at [SQLSaturday.com](https://sqlsaturday.com/), called [Site Documentation](https://sqlsaturday.com/documentation/). This is intended to explain how the site runs and how to add/edit an event.

Someone commented on a piece I'd written on [documentation](https://voiceofthedba.com/2023/04/26/creating-documentation/) and asked if I still followed my own advice and documented things well. I realized that I wasn't doing this well as SQL Saturday. As I've updated the site to add features that organizers requested, I realized this wasn't well documented.

I decided to follow my own advice and add some documentation. Since this is more for the events than the corporation, I added this at sqlsaturday.com, as opposed to this blog.

The initials doc page is an index, and there's only a description of the main event post file for now. I'll work on adding info on the redirect files and Event data files as well.

If anyone wants to help or finds issues, let me know or submit a PR.
