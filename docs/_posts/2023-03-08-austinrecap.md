I was thrilled that this event took place, while being sad I didn't attend. I actually forgot to submit, but the timing wasn't great for me, so I'm glad I didn't try to fit in this trip.

Austin is a great tech town and community. While this was a little smaller than past events, it's a good sign that many people wanted to come. They had quite a waiting list.

There are some interesting lessons in here:
- don't pay for lunch. This creates more no-shows
- raffle code. We still don't have a great solution for this

I'm looking forward to other events this year and getting to Austin in 2024.
