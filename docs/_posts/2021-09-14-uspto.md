title: "US Trademark Registration"

I got a confirmation today that the [US trademark reassignment confirmation](/assets/pdf/USPTONotice.pdf) had been received by the USPTO. This notes that the SQL Saturday corporation now owns the trademark for SQL Saturday in the US and has control over how this is used.

The trademark registrations in other countries are still pending.
