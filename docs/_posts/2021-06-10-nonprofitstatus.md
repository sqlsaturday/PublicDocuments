Today, after some research with a lawyer and accountant, I filed the [US IRS Form 1023-EX](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1023-ez) form today with the US IRS. This was to establish this corporation as a 501.c.3 entity that is a public charity to enable us to do a few things:
- First, get some donations of services from [Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/azure?) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). [TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org/) also lists some benefit for charities.
- Allow us to get donations from vendors or individuals that are tax deductable.
- Keeps us focused on our mission of helping others.

I should hear back from the IRS within a few weeks.

Disclosure: I paid for the filing fee personally for now.
