In the reboot of this 4th incarnation of SQL Saturday, I have set up [Instagram]() and ]Flickr]() accounts for the franchise. So far it's just me posting pictures, but I'd love to get more from others and tag them with the event and people.

We have an email address where you can send pictures. If you [email pictures](mailto:pix@sqlsaturday.com) to us, we'll upload them and give you credit. Let us know which event and we'll add them to the accounts. Then you can tag people in comments as you wish.

One quick request. Remind others to register here: [http://eepurl.com/hwVBKn](http://eepurl.com/hwVBKn). They can join our mailing list and find out about how SQL Saturday is growing and adapting to the new world.
